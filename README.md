# Internet Monitoring

Scripts to generate logs for monitoring internet and network conditions.

Hook up to cron job to automate these scripts.

Runs on Linux.

I have them currently running on a Raspberry Pi running at the following intervals.

- ping test every 1 min
- traceroute every 1 min
- speedtest every 10 minutes
